  <b>HTML</b>
  <p>HTML is made up of:
  <br> -Text content: what one see's
  <br> - Markup: What it looks like
  <br> - References: to other documents (example: images and videos)
  <br> - Links to other pages
  <p>Markup's make text look different and is made up of <em> tags</em>. Such as
   the <em>name, bold and emphasis</em> tag.
   <p><em><b>HTML ATTRIBUTES</b></em></p>
   HTML attributes provide additional information about and element. An example used
  was the <em> anchor</em> tag. Example below:<br>
   I am going to love learning from <a href = "udacity.com"> UDACITY</a>. Other
   tags can also be attributes such as the image tag.
   <p><b>WHITESPACE</b></p>To have <em>whitespace</em> one can use the <em>
     br</em> tag which stands for break to force multiple lines and is also a void tag which
     means that it does not need a closing tag. To enter multiple line breaks use
     the <em> p</em> tag. Although, this tag is not a void
     tag<br> therefore, it needs a closing tag. The difference between these two tags are that the 
     <em> p</em> tag is a block tag while <em> p</em> is inline.<br> Other block tags
     used are <em>div and form </em>. Inline used are <em> a, span, br, img</em>.
     <p><b> STUCTURE</b></p>
     The stucture of the document must consits of  the:
     <br> - Doctype<br> - Opening tag<br>- Metadata (Head)<br>- Title 
     <br>- Body (The content of the document)
